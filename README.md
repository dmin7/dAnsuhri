## dAnushri â€” Drum Pattern Generator for Renoise

dAnushri is a Renoise tool that brings the generative drum pattern engine from the Mutable Instruments Anushri synthesizer into the tracker world. It allows you to quickly generate, tweak, and experiment with drum patterns using intuitive controls inspired by the original hardware.

### Features
- **Generative drum patterns** based on Anushri's unique 2D style map and density controls
- **X & Y knobs** select the base pattern (style/genre)
- **Kick, Snare, HiHat density** knobs control the amount of hits for each drum
- **Swing** knob maps to Renoise groove settings
- **Velocity and Accent** knobs for expressive control (velocity scaling and beat/offbeat emphasis)
- Seamless integration with Renoise pattern editor

### Usage
1. Install the tool from the [Renoise Tools page](https://www.renoise.com/tools/danushri).
2. Open the dAnushri tool in Renoise.
3. Use the X/Y and density knobs to sculpt your drum pattern.
4. Adjust swing, velocity, and accent to taste.
5. Write patterns into Renoise and experiment with variations.

**Note:** In edit/record mode, dAnushri writes pattern data from the current playback position to the end of the pattern, allowing for easy recording of variations.
